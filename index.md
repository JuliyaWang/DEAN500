Visualization Critique

	The usage, and subsequent study, of visual aids in data representation and analysis calls upon the current age of rapid technological advancement in society albeit not its beginning. According to Mackinlay, Shneiderman, and Card, “The progress of civilization can be read in the invention of visual artifacts, from writing to mathematics, to maps, to printing, to diagrams, to visual computing”.  Relative to common historical knowledge, humans have used visualization whether it be cave drawings, artistic representations, or mathematical formulations (such as Pythagoras) for thousands of years. Visualizations provide humans with a means to express a multitude of complexities which can be distinctly seen in the Financial realm. In this critique, I will present 2 static visualizations – one positive, another poorly constructed – and explicate each to demonstrate their positive and negative traits as well as how they relate to the field of informative visualization with nods to Big Data (information technology) and the larger financial sector. 

	Barking against the general trend, this critique will start with a poor example of static visualization as it is often helpful to see negative design so that the viewer is keener on the positives of the well-design visualization. The visualization that I have chosen is entitled “Advantages of Working From Home” (Fig.1). The intended goal of this visualization is to represent 5 advantages of staying at home using a pie chart to demonstrate the value of each respectively. The intended audience is directly those working professionals who inherently work at home as well as anyone interested to view the benefits of working from home (including but not exclusively: those in the job market who are looking at ‘in person’ and ‘work from home’ jobs, retired individuals considering making extra money, and college students). The visualization represents specifically nominal information – as will be seen, a weakness – in presenting the chart which is color-coded for viewers. This pie chart encodes one data dimension: place. The place is literally “at home” with no other variables present. The encoding mappings are essentially non-existent as this visualization does not even provide percentages or a key. Core tasks that his chart enables are providing examples of advantages from working at home. The user will want to know variables which this visualization provides readily. Outside of this observation, there is nothing else of substance. In my opinion, this visualization does not serve its intended purpose as it is missing key elements that are essential for meaningful analysis and understanding such a nominal data.

The 3 strengths that this visualization displays are simplicity of design, valid examples, and varied color display. Simplicity of design can be seen in the creator’s usage of a pie chart that has 5 different points. The viewer can immediately identify each point and have an understanding of what the creator is trying to present in the graph. Additionally, each of the titles are presented in large font which make the points easily readable. The second strength are valid details that the creator uses. What is meant by “valid details” is that each piece of the chart makes sense of a coherent argument for working from home. Although word choice may not be scholastic, it is clear to any reader. It can also not be determined the age of the creator which makes it difficult to evaluate depth and breadth of advanced language and knowledge. The third, and final strength, is that the colors used in the pie chart are easily discernable for the human eye and can easily be identified as differing points. This is beneficial because the creator made valid color choices that positively reflected in pieces of the chart (points) being clear to the reader. That said, we will see in the next paragraph that “color” is a double-edged sword. 
	The 3 weaknesses of this visualization are missing percentages/values for each point, color orientation generally, and overall quality of examples. The first point, missing percentages/values, is by far the biggest issue with this chart. Without values, how is the reader supposed to know the results of the polling. As well, each of the pie chart “slices” appears to be the same size which would mean that the polling data was split 20% for each of the five options which is impossible. This disregard by the chart tarnishes the validity of this chart as there is even no way to know whether or not he/she performed the study. As is, it appears that the creator literally copy/pasted the chart, colored it (maybe if not already colored) and assigned names to each slice of the chart. The second weakness is, aforementioned, color orientation. According to Bertin’s “Level of Organization”, we know that color is nominal and should be viewed as the least accurate in determining quantitative perceptual tasks. The use of color here does nothing to improve the graph and thus would be an essential weakness. The last weakness is the overall quality of the examples provided. For example, let’s look at “Discover and Cook with Exciting New Recipes”. The questions are if this is really an advantage of working from home as even those who work full-time jobs can engage in this pursuit after work or on their days off. There is no evidence that there is a difference between those who work at home and those who work in an office setting. For “longish” lunch breaks this issue arises again that begs the question of misleading examples. The issue this creator faces is that of graphical presentation. Scholar Jock D. Mackinley states, “The graphical presentation problem is to synthesize a graphical design that expresses a set of relations and their structural properties effectively”.  What Mackinley is saying is that graphical design is intertwined with relations and structural properties and without proper execution the resulting visualization is subpar. The effectivity of this mapping is also called into question. According to Mackinley, “A mapping is said to be more effective if it is faster to interpret, can convey more distinctions, or leads to fewer errors than some other mappings”.  Clearly this visualization is not effective because there are errors throughout which have resulted in the validity being called into question. Additionally, although it is fast to interpret, there is no quantitative data to support qualified conclusions. 
	The only improvements that I could suggest would be to go back to the drawing board, conduct and record qualitative data, express that data clearly in the pie chart (make sure that the result equal 100%), use varied colors, and provided a color-coded key for the reader. As well, pie charts should not be used as a sole visualization but rather in complement with other visualizations in tandem. 
	I like this visualization for its clarity of display (personal bias towards pie charts), and for its subject matter. That said, this chart is highly flawed and in need of some major revisions as explained above. 

	 
	The second, contrasting, example that I have chosen is the “COVID-19 Dashboard” (Fig. 2) created by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The intended goal of this static visualization is to track the spread of Coronavirus 2019/19 on regional, national, and international levels. This visualization provides health professionals as well as ordinary citizens with useful information that they can form conclusions based off of without having to look at each and every individual country. As aforementioned, this visualization represents the amount of confirmed COVID-19 cases that each country has so far, the recovery rate, and death rate. This visualization encompasses 3 data dimensions: Products, Place, and Time. Products would be represented by the COVID-19 virus; Place would be each country; Time would be statics based on daily and monthly totals. The encoding mappings are appropriate and succeed in their purpose in this visualization. This visualization lends itself to comparisons of time to place to amount of cases. The multi-variable dynamic and fluidity is what provides the substance and support. Regarding evaluations, there are definitely substantial grounds for conclusion-based analysis with logical conclusions being drawn. In my opinion, this visualization definitely serves its purpose to record and present pertinent information on COVID-19 to the viewers. The support for my conclusion comes from the plethora of information and well-designed visualization that can be found on the site which speak for itself. The team at the CSSE are amount the most validated in the United States for their contributions to groundbreaking scientific analysis and scholarship.

The three strengths of this static visualization are the high quality of information, the variety of visual designs used, and the quantitative means utilized in the presentation. Firstly, the high quality of information is a direct result of the scholars who contributed to this visualization. It can be observed that the information is displayed in a manner that is easily readable and accessible with just enough detail given to be of use for both professionals and ordinary citizens. Additionally, the constantly updating (every few minutes) information being pulled into the visualization is relative to its benefit. Secondly, the variety of visual designs used is of essence to the visualization. Looking at the diagram (Fig. 2), we can see that multiple high order implementations have been included such as graphs and scatterplots. These are expressed using a variety of contrasting visual techniques in order to provide the best viewing for the observer. This is compared to a graph that would be ordinarily black and white showing the differentiation between the two. The last benefit is the amount of quantitative measures used here from Color and Density ranging upwards to Area and further up Position. Mackinlay, Shneiderman, and Card state, “Visualizations can allow patterns in the data to revel themselves”.  The creator’s intention was to incorporate a variety of perceptual tasks in order to build a visualization that was varied in nature. The successful implementation of these is proof of the high quality of this example. 
	The three weaknesses of this visualization are usage of density, color usage, and lack of explanations. The usage of density on the scatterplot makes it very confusing for the viewer to clearly see the values of the areas with the densest spread of COVID-19. As well, the choice of only representing Density in black (with variably small and large dots) makes it even harder for the viewer to see what the creator is trying to present. I think that there could have been a better choice which would have involved positional data with clear comments either within the chart or accessed via a key next to the chart. The second weakness is that of color usage in the visualization. Color is at the bottom of accuracy for quantitative perceptual tasks as it does not provide hard numbers that represent the data shown but rather only acknowledge the differences between various data. The choice of red on the map makes interpretation very difficult for the viewer. Rather then observing clearly defined sectors of COVID-19 spread, Area is aggregated densely making the map difficult to read. The last weakness is the lack of explanations for the data. This was chosen because although many can make assumptions and inferences about Data, it is difficult to qualify observations without having explanations provided that go hand-in-hand with the graphs. By rule, graphs should always have explanations to aid the viewer in their understanding even if they are simplified. This critique can easily be improved upon within minutes of the creator adding in context. 
	Overall, the second visualization is very well done. The only improvements that I could suggest would be to re-examine the COVID-19 spread map and change the style away from blot-mapping and more towards a quantitative presentation. As well, the lack of simple explanations for the graphs is a negative and the creator should focus on providing the viewer with more details regarding each of these. I like this visualization because it provides a clear and concise entry into understanding the quantitative data surrounding COVID-19 for professionals and ordinary citizens alike. Someone viewing a static visualization wants to see detail-oriented design, stellar presentation, and easily understandable graphs that provide information that the viewer can absorb in a short amount of time. 

	In conclusion, this critique looked at two very different visualizations. The first one was an excellent example of how a graph can be created poorly and still presented as more than it is. The “Advantages of Working From Home” suffered in that it was simply constructed and missing essential data such as percentages for each advantage and a pie chart representation that showed the weight of each benefit. As well, the color schema impacted it negatively. On the other hand, the second visualization the “COVID-19 Dashboard” was highly successful in presenting superb graphs through using quantitative data including Density, Area, and Position. The graphs were clearly presented and supported with detailed information that was updated continuously through the course of the day.
